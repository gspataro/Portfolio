I've been studying piano since I was four years old. At the end of the high school I completed my piano studies at the Vincenzo Bellini conservatory in Catania with the vote of 110/110 cum laude.

In the years I sustained a lot of performances both as a solo pianist and as an accompanist. My repertoire favors the romantic period but I'm open to any kind
of musical experience.
